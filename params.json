{"name":"Ims-lti","tagline":"A Ruby library to help implement IMS LTI tool consumers and providers (MIL Fork adds new data extensions)","body":"### MIL-IMS-LTI\r\nThis is the Middlebury Interactive Languages fork of the [Instructure IMS-LTI](https://github.com/instructure/ims-lti) gem.  It adds a new outcome data type that allows instructors to have instructor graded assignments within the [Middlebury platform](http://www.middleburyinteractive.com) on any LMS through LTI.\r\n\r\n## Problem\r\nSubmitting a grade through LTI will have it graded immediately.  This prevents an instructor from having a chance to see a list of submissions that `need grading` and giving each student a grade\r\nbased on the students work for an `essay` or `audio` submission etc.\r\n\r\n## Solution\r\nAdding a new outcome data extension key/value pair that will allow a submission to be marked as needs grading.  This prevents the LMS from grading the assignment and allows the instructor to review it first and give it a grade accordingly.\r\n\r\n## Usage\r\n\r\nFirst create a tool provider with the OutcomeData extensions:\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\n\ttp = IMS::LTI::ToolProvider.new(consumer_key, shared_secret, lti_params)\r\n    tp.extend IMS::LTI::Extensions::OutcomeData::ToolProvider \r\n```\r\n\r\nNext check the lms for support and use post_replace_result_with_data with the new `needs_grading` param:\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\n\tif tp.accepts_outcome_needs_grading? \r\n    \ttp.post_replace_result_with_data!(score_lti,'needs_grading' => 'true')\r\n   \tend\r\n```\r\n\r\nOptionally use url to give the instructor a link to the students work for grading:\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\n\tif tp.accepts_outcome_needs_grading? && tp.accepts_outcome_url?\r\n    \ttp.post_replace_result_with_data!(\r\n    \t\tscore_lti,\r\n    \t\t'needs_grading' => 'true',\r\n    \t\t'url' => 'http://www.example.com/assignment/student_id'\r\n    \t)\r\n   \tend\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Add this gem to your project\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ gem install mil-ims-lti\r\n```\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\n\t# Gemfile\r\n\tgem 'mil-ims-lti', '~> 1.1.6'\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Requires LMS implementation\r\nEach LMS will need to implement and accept the `needs_grading` data type then use this value when present to prevent grading from happening on a submission recieved from LTI. This modification has been made to the [MIL fork of Canvas](https://github.com/SpeakEZ/canvas-lms) as an example.\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nThis was added by the Middlebury Interactive Languages Development team. \r\n","google":"UA-32662727-3","note":"Don't delete this file!
